ΝΟ TES. 5 7

175. genitalis origo, ‘ the first birth-time ’. ,

176—180 form a digression. Lucr. has been saying that the gods
could gain nothing by the creation of men ; he now goes on to say that
men could have no quarrel with the godS‚ if they had never been
created.

creatis: the acc. could stand here as well as the dat. ; see creatum,
1. 180.

177. The order of the words is at first sight strange as the metre
would allow debet enim natus quicunque est3 but natus gains emphasis
thus, and the separation of natus and est is quite in the manner of
Lucr.; see n. to l. 90.

178. donec, ‘ as long as ’.

180. in numero, sc. viventium, ‘included among the living’.

obest, sc. ei.

181. gignundis is archaic for gignendis, like reddunda, l. 66.

182. notities is intended to represent the technical Epicurean term
πρόληψις, ‘preconception' of mankind, i.e. idea of what men were
like. See 1. 1047 and Introduct. p. xxiv. If no rnen! existed, there could
be no images (εἴδωλα) of them, and consequently no conception (πρόληψις)
of what they were like.

184. principiorum: these principia (ἀρχαί), or primordia rerum
(στοιχεῖα), are the atoms of Epicurus, the ultimate and indivisible
elements of all matter; see Introduct. p. xxii.

Lucr. uses principiorum as the gen. of primordia, just as he uses
arbusta for the plur. of arbor, to suit the requirements of his mette ι see
n. to l. 671.

185. quidque...posscnt: an indirect question, which is in fact a
second subject to cognita est.

186. natura: in the Epicurean philosophy nature and chance are
identified; comp. 1. 77 with l. 107.

187. ita is followed by ut, 1. 192.

188. plagae are the blows inflicted by atoms on each other.

189. concita goes with ponderibus.

analogy from multimodis (=multz's modis).
