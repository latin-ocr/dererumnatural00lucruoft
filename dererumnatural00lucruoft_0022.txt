that the Romans were practically unanimous in ranking Virgil as
the peer of Homer and sar above all other Latin poets ¹. It is
very improbable that they would have allowed even the proximi
honores to Lucretius. We are not entitled to settle such a
question absolutely, by our own standards and our own preser-
ences ; how should we feel ourselves, if a highly educated
Hindoo asked us to take his word for it, that Marlowe was
a greater poet than Shakespeare, or Wordsworth than
Milton?

Itis interesting to notice that the relation between the two
poets is by no means one of unmixed sympathy. When we
consider the religious and almost mystical temperament of
Virgss, his respect for tradition, and the difference of his
political and social surroundings, we cannot wonder that he is
repelled as well as attracted by the genius for which he expresses
an almost despairing admiration. ‘Virgil is no mere disciple of
Lucretius, either as regards his philosophy or his art. Though
his imagination pays homage to that of the older poet ; though
he acknowledges his contemplative elevation ; though he has a
strong affinity with the deep humanity of his nature 3 yet in his
profoundest convictions and aspirations he proclaims his revolt
from him².'

It will be observed that in many of the passages of Virgil
where we find an echo of Lucretius, the sense is quite different
though the words are like or even identical. This is most
easily accounted for, by supposing that his mind was so saturated
with the writings of his predecessor, that he reproduced the
cadences and even words without being conscious of it. An
example may be taken from another pair of Latin poets. Every
reader of Martial is struck by the number of allusions to
Catullus and imitations os him. But there are also resemblances
of a subtler kind. For instance, Catullus in one of his poems
reproaches Calvus for sending him a present of some bad poetry,

and vows to take revenge by sending him a similar present in
return :
