PREFACE.

THE fifth book of Lucretius contains some of his
finest work and also, being less technical and dry than
any of the other books, is best suited to serve as an
introduction to the study of the De Rerum lVatura. This
edition has been prepared with that object in view: it aims
both at explaining this one book in detail for beginners and
at smoothing the way to the comprehension of other and
more difficult parts of the poem.

My obligations are very great, in all parts of my book,
to Munro's famous edition. In the Introduction, I have
also made considerable use of Professor Sellar's sympathetic
and felicitous criticism in his two volumes on the Roman
poets3 and much of my fourth Section is abridged from
Zeller. For the astronomical Section Î™ have to thank the
dexterity and kindness of Mr H. L. Callendar, Fellow of
Trinity College. It may be worth saying here that the
astronomical theories of Lucretius are simple enough, so
long as they are purely fanciful, and difficult only when they
approximate to the truth. Consequently the information
here given is only a simplification of what may be found in
the ordinary astronomical text-books.
