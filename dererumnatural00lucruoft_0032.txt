xxviii INTRODUCTJON.

with the equator EQWR‚ exactly half of which is above the
horizon, so that the lengths of day and night are equal. In the
figure the node or point of intersection is for convenience repre-
sented as just setting at W3 the ecliptic is shown in the position
which it would occupy at 6 p.m. on March 21st. The sun
crosses the equator again from North to South at the time of
the autumnal equinox, in the sign of the Scales; rising at E
at 6 am. on Sept. 23rd.

The Solstices are the points C and L of the sun's annual
path at which he is furthest from the equator, The sun is at
C and due south at noon on June 22nd. On that day his daily
course is the circle CG, the greater half of which is above the
horizon, so that the day is longer than the night. The sun is at
L at midnight on Dec. 21st3 the greater half of his daily course
LK, is then below the horizon (see ll. 682—686).

These points are called Solstices because the sun, after
moving away from the equator, appears to stop and turn back.
They are also called T reples, i.e. turning points. The summer
solstice C is in the sign of Cancer (the Crab), the winter solstice
L in that of Capricorn (the Goat); see ll. 615—617.

Eclz‘pses. The moon completes the circuit of the Zodiac once
a mouth. Her orbit is slightly inclined to the ecliptic; if it co-
incided with the ecliptic, it is evident that the moon would pass
between the earth and the sun every month, causing an eclipse.
As it is, eclipses can only occur when the moon happens to be
near one of the nodes of her orbit, i.e. those points where her orbit
intersects the ecliptic, An eclipse of the sun can only occur at
new moon, when the moon is between the sun and the earth; an
eclipse of the moon, at full moon, when the moon is on the side
of the earth opposite to the sun, and passes through the cone of
the earth's shadow (see 1. 764).
