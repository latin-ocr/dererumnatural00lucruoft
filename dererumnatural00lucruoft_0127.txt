925—987. Αἴθη were much more hardy then than now. T hey did not

beasts and sleep naked on beds of leaves. As tlzey had always been

their caves and beds of leaves.

Bagehot‚ Physics and Politics, p. 15, says ‘Perhaps it is the most
valuable, as it is clearly the most certain result of prehistoric ethnology,

that it has dispelled the dreams of other days as to a primitive high
