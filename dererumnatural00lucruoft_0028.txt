from the body; it was born together with it and will die with it.
Death therefore is nothing to us, as sensation cannot survive
for a moment the separation of body and soul.

Lucretius brings forward no less than twenty-seven arguments
against the immortality of the soul. He is anxious to leave no
doubt on the point, as he believes that the unhappiness of men
is mainly due to their sear of punishment in a future lise.

(3) PERCEPTIONS AND CONCEP‘rioNs. All knowledge,
according to Epicurus, depends on the senseS. Their evidence
is unimpeachable: when we get a wrong impression of some
object we see, the blame rests, not with our sensation, but with
our judgment of the sensation, i.e. with the mind, not with the
eyes. By a repetition of the same perception there arises a
conception or notion (πρόληψις), which is called by Lucretius
notities, and more accurately by Cicero antz'cz'pasio. This notion
is a general picture, retained in the mind, of what has been
perceived. The origin of perceptions is explained in the
following way. Exceedingly fine films (εἴδωλα, simulacra) are
constantly being discharged from the surface of all bodies,
bearing the exact likeness of the body itself. These films move
with infinite speed through void and are conveyed to the soul
by the various organs of sense. When we see a horse, an
image has corne from the horse and passed through our eyes
into the soul. Taste‚ hearing, and smell are explained in just
the same way; only the atoms of smells travel slower than the
atoms of sounds, and the atonis of sounds slower than the
atoms of visible things. Thought also is excited entirely by
material images3 if we think of a Centaur, our thought is
due to an image of a horse which has got mixed up with the
image of a man. Lucretius goes so far as to say that when
we dream of dead friends, our dream is due to a material
image of them; but it seems impossible to explain how any-
thing that no longer exists can discharge an image. Finally to
imagcs is ascribed the origin of belief in the gods; but here too
there is some inconsistencyl.
