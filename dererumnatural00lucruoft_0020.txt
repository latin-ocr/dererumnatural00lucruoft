but, like other Latin poetS, thought he had a right to make
what use he pleased of his Greek and Roman predecessors.
And he has merits of his own unsurpassed in the whole compass
of Latin poetry. It has often struck me that his genius is akin
to that of Milton. He displays a wonderful depth and fervour
of thought, expressed in language of singular force and beauty;
an admirable faculty of clear and vigorous and well-sustained
philosophical reasoning; and a style equal in its purity and
correctness to that of Terence, Caesar or Cicero, and superior
to that of any writer of the Augustan age¹.'

111. LUCRETms AND V1Ro1L.

Non verba autem sola sed versus prope totos et locos quoque
Lucreti plurimos sectatmn esse Vergy·lz·u212 videmus.
Aulus Gellius i 21 7.

NVhen the poem of Lucretius was published, Virgil was
fifteen years of age. ‘ At such an age therefore the style and
manner of Lucretius were able to iinpress themselves fully on
the younger poet's susceptible mind ; and perhaps the highest
eulogy which has ever been passed on the former is that con-
stant imitation of his language and thought which pervades
Virgil’s works from one end to the other 23 It may be added
that this influence was at its height at the time when the
Georgics, and especially the second, were written.

Virgil never mentions Lucretius directly3 but this is not
surprising when we remember that he does not mention
Theocritus once in the Eclogues‚ nor Hesiod by name in the
Georgics, nor Homer at all in the Aeneid. There is however
one passage which is unmistakably intended to carry an allusion
to Lucretius. The lines are as follows z

Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,
Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum
Subiecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari.
