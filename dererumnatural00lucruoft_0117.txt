705—7 50. Τ he phases eff the moon may be explained in various rvays.
She may derive her lzgrlzt from the sun, so that she is at the full
when she z's right opposite him, but gradually loses her lzght as she
approaches him, and is quite dark when between the earth and the
sun. Or her lzght may be her own, and the phases may be due to an
opaque satellite of her own which is constantly getting in her way and
shutting out her lzght from us. Or z't may be true, as the C haldaeans
teach, that she is a sphere os which only one haff is bright; the
revolution of such a sphere would bring about the phases we see. Or,
lastly, a fresh moon may be born every day, each with a dffrent
phase, in regular successz‘on ; we see many things come round in
regular successz'on, as for inslance the four seasons.

The account Lucr. gives first is the true one ; see p. xxviii ; it is quite
incompatible with his own views as to the size of the sun and moon.
