JNTRODUCTJON. xv

Many have thought that Lucretius was singularly unfortunate
in his choice of a subject. A great poet has said that poetry
should be simple, sensuous, impassioned; and it would be
difficult for any poem, consisting mainly of the exposition of a
philosophical system, to satisfy these conditions. This is
especially true of the Epicurean philosophy, which, at least on its
metaphysical side, is of all systems the least lofty and the least
profound.

Yet, in spite of his unattractive subject, his archaism‚ and his
monotonous verse, the poem of Lucretius is immortal. The
greatness is in the man rather than in the theme. In the
doctrine of atoms there is much that is wonderful and striking
to the imagination ; but after all it is the personality and poetic
power of Lucretius that make his work a possession for ever—
his noble enthusiasm, his profound pathos, his intellectual
seriousness, and his descriptive genius. In our own age his
poem ἐκείῐεῖᾆεῖξῦἶίἐῑ interest, because of its scientific spirit, and
because it discusses the very same problems of religion, science,
and anthropology which we are engaged in discussing over .
again. To his great qualities there is no lack of testimony.
Few have known ancient and modern literature as Macaulay
did ; and he says of Lucretius z ‘ In energy, perspicuity, variety
of illustration, knowledge of life and manners, talent for descrip-
tion, sense of the beauty of the externa] world, and elevation
and dignity of moral feeling, Lucretius had hardly ever an
equal¹.' Munro too, as competent a judge as any man who ever
lived, sums up his opinion thus: ‘It would hardly perhaps do
violence to the taste of the present age to call Lucretius the
greatest of extant Latin poets. Like the rest of his countrymen,
he is not a great creative genius ; we find in him many echoes

 

even of the scanty fragments which we yet possess of the old'
tragic and epic poets‚ Accius, Pacuvius, and, above all, Ennius.
He owes still more to the Greeks, especially Empedocles, so far
as regards the form of his poem....Fr0m the splendid eulogies
which in his first book he passes on Ennius and Empedocles,
we may feel sure that he did not wish to conceal his obligations,
