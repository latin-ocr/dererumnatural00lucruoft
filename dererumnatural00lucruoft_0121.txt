NOTES. 85

776. quovez see n. to 1. 71. qffi’cto: Lucr. elsewhere uses a
personal passive of officere, though the verb does not take an aec.

777. neque opinantes: the common form is necopinum, in one
word.

778. lumine, ‘eye'3 keeping up the metaphor of conivent and
convisunt.

780. nunc redeo: the digression began at 1. 509.

et mollia etc.‚ ⁴ and to the tendet age of the fields of earth ’.

781. Before quid, sc. et doceo. luminis oras: see n. to 1. 85.

782. crerint (creverint)=decrerint; in 1. 393 cernere=decernere in
a rather different sense. Comp. Virg. Aen. xi 560 quae nunc dubiis
committitur auris.

783—820. The earth brought forth grass and trees first of all and then
living· creatures of all kinds. A'either sky nor sea had anythz‘ng to
do with the first creation of men,· mother earth herself brought
them fhrth, first birds, and then men who sprung from the earth
and were fed by a moisture like milk, issuing from the ground.
At that time there was no severe weather to trouble the first-created
men.

783. principt'o, ‘in the beginning '.

785. fulserunt: this aorist, and others in the context, seem to imply
that all this came to pass very quickly.

786. arboribus: for nom. Lucr. uses arbusta: see n. to 1. 671.

variis, ‘of different kinds ’.

787. inmissis habenis, ‘with unbridled luxuriance'3 the metaphor
is imitated by virgil, Georg. ii 364; comp. ὀξυτέρῳ χαλινῷ, Soph.
Antig. 109.

788. primum, i.e. as soon as beasts and birds are born.

789. pennipotentum, ‘of the strong of wing ’, i.e. birds3 this is one
of the many Lucretian eompounds which Virgil did not care to use.

791. inde loci: see n. to 1. 443. mortalia saecla here includes the
lower animals as well as men, though it usually=mortales and excludes
the mutae pecudes et saecla ferarum 3 so ll. 805, 988, 1 169, 1238.

794. terrestria is not a mere epithet but=quia terrestria sunt.
lacunis, sc. maris.

795. linquitur: impers. Of the four elements one, fire, can have
no claim, and Lucr. has dismissed the claim of two others; the only
remaining hypothesis is that earth is the general mother.
