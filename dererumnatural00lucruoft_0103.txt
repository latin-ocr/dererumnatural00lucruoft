a change of construction at l. 386.

384. exsuperarint is sut. perf.

385. neque adhuc=scd nondum. patrarunt is a probable correction

386. tantum, ‘so much’. ultra, ‘besides ’‚ not content with
keeping the fire down; ultro is very common in this sense in Tacitus.

387. diluviare: pres. infin.‚ instead of future, common in old Latin
