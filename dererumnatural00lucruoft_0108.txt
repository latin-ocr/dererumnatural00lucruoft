72 LUCRETIUS. BOOK V.

and the motion of the stars is due to a third air, which blows, either
above the sphere in the direction in which the slars move, or below
the sphere in the contrary direci'z'on. If the sky does not revolve, the
motion τῃ( the stars z's due ez'llzer to heats inside themselves, or to an
air from without, or to their own volitt'on. It is impossible to say
which of these causes operates in our world ,· but one of these men-
tioned it must be.

This paragraph interrupts the narrative, and there '15 no place in
the book where it fits in naturally, though it ought properly to come
in with the description of sun and moon. It appears to have been
a subsequent addition which was never properly connected with the
rest.

509. There is no special mention of the planets here or elsewhere
in the book.

510. Lucr. regards this as an open question though he speaks, l.
1436, of mundi versatile templum.

511. ex utraque parti, ‘at each pole ’. polum is the axis, not the
pole, of the sphere of heaven. aera is the subject to premere.

51²· utrimque, ‘ at both ends '. The two airs serve to keep the
axis of the sphere steady3 a third is required to put the sphere in
motion. It is important to realise that the stars are included in the
sphere3 comp. 1. 1²05·

513. alium, sc. aera.

514. quo volvenda micant=quo volvuntur micantia. volvenda
:volventia of 1. 931, the gerundive being used as pres. particip.;

5ι5. alium, sc. aerafluere. subvehat: final.

516. The wheel here spoken of, still common in the East, is
intended for irrigation; it is made to revolve by the current, and draws
water out of the river by means of the haustra, ‘scoops’, attached to it.
These scoops are mentioned here only because they are fastened to the
wheel as the stars are to the sphere of heaven. fluvios is the subject to

versare.
