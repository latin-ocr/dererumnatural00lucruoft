96 LUCRETJUS. BOOK V.

1026. aut, ‘ or else ¹. iam lum, ‘ thus early ’.
1027. prb‘pago: nom. sing. ; for quantity of verb, see n. to l. 850.

¹028-1090. Language arose from a natural instinct to denote
dfflrent things by dzfflrent names. Children try to speak before
they are able to do so, just as young animals instinctively exert
their peculiar powers. It is not true that some one man invented
the names of things and taught everyone else ,· no single man could
have conceived such an idea, nor would others have been willing to
learn from him. There is nothing in the ortgin qf language to
surprise us, z'f we reflect that even animals express dzffi’rent emotions
in quite diffi³reut lones‚· this may be observed in dogs, horses, and
birds of many kinds.

This question was much discussed by the ancients, whether the
names of things were arbitrarily fixed or arose naturally, whether
they were due to θέσις or φύσις. The view of Lucretius is shared by
Darwin. '

10²9· mittere, ἱέναι, ‘to utter '3 the inf. after subegit is unusual for
ut and subj., though normal after cogere. utilitas seems to be used like
χρεία, in the sense of ‘need'. expressit, ‘ wrung out of them '.

1030. Comp. l. 460. videtur is passive.

1031. infantia, ‘inability to speak ’‚ the original meaning of the
word; so infans, l. 223.

1033. vim: the acc. after utor and its compounds and such verbs
as fruor, fungor, potior, is an archaism.

quoad (ssquatenus) is one syllable by synizesis.

abuti=uti3 comp. ἀποχρῆσθαι. abuti οἷῐεῃεκαταχρῆσθαι.

1035. illis, i.e. frontibus inermibus. petit: comp. Hor. Sat. ii 1
5² dente lupus, cornu taurus petit.

1036. σκύμνοι is the Greek equivalent of catuli.

1037. iam tum: as in l. 1026.

1039. alituum: see n. to l. 801.

1040. tremulum, ¹ fluttering ’-

1041. aliquem, ‘ some one man ’.

1042. inde=ab eo, ‘ from him '.

1045. tempore eodem=tamen and goes with putentur, not with
facere; comp. 11. 756, 765, where the construction is exactly the
same, being asyndetic‚ i.e. there is no particle (such as scd) to connect
the two contrasted verbs, posset and putentur.
