1126. This invidia bears some resemblance to the Nemesis, or
envy os the gods, in the old mythology which Lucr. utterly discards 3
but see n. tol. 1233.

Tartara taetra, ‘noisome Tartarus'3 the infernal regions are men-
tioned to suggest the distance and disastrous nature of the sall.

1 128. quae and cumque make up a single word.

1135. Ambition is no new thing, says Lucretius.

1136-1160, leus kings were slain, and anarchy prevailed until
magistrates were appointed and codes of law drawn up. Men
submitted more readily to the restraz'nls of law, because tlze former
system of unlimited revenge gave birth to feuds which poisoned all
the peace and happiness of life.

1136. Kings were slain because their greatness attracted the stroke
of envy as has just been said. Perhaps Lucr. is thinking of the expul-
sion of kings from Rome, and below (11. 1 143, 1144) of the consuls and
decemvirs.

1137. Comp. Shirley’s Ode:

Sceptre and crown must tumble down,
And in the dust be equal made
With the poor crooked scythe and spade.

1138. insigne, i.e. the crown; used as a noun, as in l. 700.
cruentum is part of the predicate, ‘in blood ’.
