nol a source qs death as no one venlured upon it. Want may leave
killed some, as luxury cloes now,· and some swallowed poisons uu-
awares wlcz'clz we now use as medicinas.

988. nimio plus, ‘ more by much ’3 it commonly means ‘too mueh',
as in l [or. Od. i 3 3 1 nc doleas plus nimio. mortalia saecla: see n. to
l. 79¹-

989. labentis, ‘ ebbing ’3 for the alliteration and also sor the matter,
comp. Gray's ‘ nor cast one longing lingering look behind ’.

990. magis, sc. quam nunc.

991. haustus, ‘torn ’, a rather strange but quite common use ol
haurire 3 comp. ll. 1069, 1324.

993. vivo buslo, i.e. the animal’s maw. viscera: see n. tol. 903.
Notice the alliteration, which has a pathetic effect.

deity who corresponds to Πλούτων, the god of the lower world.

997. donique: see n. to l. 708; the plpf. aster donec is unexampled
in Lucr. vermina, ‘ gripings '.

998. vellent, ‘ needed ’, viz. for cure.

999. virum: gen. plur. sub signis ducta, ‘marching beneath their
standards’. milia should always be spelt with one l, the rule being
that when a long vowel is followed by ll, one l is withdrawn where an
i follows, (unless this z' be merely the mark of a case, eg. villa villis);
so mille but milia, villa but vilicus, Messalla but Messalina.

1000. Comp. 1. 95.

1002. lzic=tum3 so 1. 432. temere incassum frustra, ‘ without
aim, purpose, or result ² ; a very pleonastie expression, as all three
words express nearly the same idea.

1003. saevibat: see n. to scibat, 1. 934.

1005. in fraudem, ‘to his hu1·t'; this sense offraus is common in
old legal formulas where sine fraude εςίοεοὶθῷον εἶναι in Greek laws.
ridentibus: so Aesch. Prom. 89 ποντίων τε κυμάτων ἀνήριθμον γέλασμα.

1006. improba ratio, ‘the reckless art '. caeca, ‘hidden ’.

1007. tum deinde, ‘ at that time too ’.

1009. inprudentes, ἄκοντες, ‘ unwittingly ’ς comp. Virg. Georg.
ii 152 nec miseros fallunt aconila legentes.

1010. ‘now doctors prescribe and administer it with more skill '.
