property. At first beauty and strength were hzghly regarded, but
these had soon to give way to wealth, though the philosopher despises
riches. Men struggled sor honour and wealth and often came to
ruz'n in the struggle ,· let them continue along that dangerous path,
as they will not judge things for themselves hut are content to accept
the estz‘mate of others.
