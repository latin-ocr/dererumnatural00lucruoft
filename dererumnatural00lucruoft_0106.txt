70 LUCRETJUS. BOOK V.

454. efficerent: consec. subj. Lucr. will not admit anything like
design in the formation of the world; consequently the final subj. is
inappropriate here. ‘The walls of the great world' are the ether,
mundus being used as in 1. 433.

456. minoribu' : see n. to 1. 53.

457. rara, ‘ porous ⁹, not ‘ scattered '.

459. levis: transl. by the adverb sor convenience, and notice the
meaning different from lbvz'bus above.

460. ‘ much in the same way as '; again, l. 1030. The construction
is a little irregular : videmus should be followed by an acc. and inf., but
at l. 465 the sentence takes a different turn.

461. aurea...matutz·na: see n. to l. ¹3·

464. ut, ‘as'; ut ⁴ when ², is probably not Lucretian.

465. quae, the mist from the water and smoke from the ground.

in alto, ‘on high’3 again, 1. 584.

466. corpore concreto: because clouds are substantial compared to
mist and smoke.

subtexunt etc. ι ‘as clouds they weave a covering beneath the sky ’ 3
nubila is in apposition. Comp. vi 482 aestus...subtexz't caerula nimbis.

468. circumdatus, ‘ sweeping round ’-

469. partes, ‘directions ’.

470. avido: comp. avidi montes 1. 201.

471. exordia, ‘ rudiments ’ ; see n. to l. 33¹·

472. interutrasque, ⁴ in the middle ’‚ i.e. between earth and ether;
an adverb formed like foras, alias3 comp. interea.

475. Before levia repeat tam. labier: archaic for labi.

476. ita sunt ut, ‘though they are..., yet they...’; the lz'mztalive
use of z'ta ut.

viva, like aeternam l. 402, is a merely poetical epithet; sor comp.
11. 122—125.

477. mundi totius includes earth, sky, and sea.

extent = sint.

478. quod genus is adverbial‚ like omne genus, l. 4²3·

in nobis, ‘in our bodies '.

479. sint ea quae mov„ ἔστιν ἅ κινεῖται, ‘ some are in motion '.

480. retractis, ‘withdrawn'.

482. fossas: κοίλους τόπους in the original (see Plut. de plac. phil.
i 4) which Lucr. seems to be translating.

483. circum: adverb. aestus, ‘heats'.
