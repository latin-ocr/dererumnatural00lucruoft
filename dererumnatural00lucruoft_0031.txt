imagine himself at the centre O of the sphere. In the accom-
panying figure, which represents the celestia] sphere as seen in
latitude 60⁰ N., the places of the stars are not shown, but only
some imaginary circles to which their positions are referred.

The observer’s Horz'zon is represented by the circle NESW.
The half, NLP‘S, below the horizon, is of course invisible to the
observer.

The Axis, POP', is the direction of the earth’s axis of rotation,
round which, in consequence of the earth's rotation, the starry
sphere appears to turn. The ancients believed that the earth
was really at rest in the centre of the universe and that the stars
were fixed to an invisible frame-work which revolved round the
earth.

The Poles P, P‘, are the points in which the axis meets the
sphere ; they are called the North and South Poles respectively.

The Equator EQWR is an imaginary circle midway between
the poles. It meets the horizon in the East and &Vest points, E
and W.

The sun has two apparent motions‚ which are both really
due to motions of the earth. The rotation of the earth on its
axis makes him appear to rise and set every day3 while the
revolution of the earth in its orbit round the sun makes him
appear to travel round the sky once a year.

The Eclzptz'c‚ ECWL, is the apparent annual path of the sun
among the stars. The celestial sphere appears to turn from
East to West3 but the sun, in his annual path, appears to
travel in the contrary direction.

The Zodz'ac, so named from the animals (ζῴδια) by which the
constellations are represented, is a narrow belt of sky on either
side of the ecliptic. It is divided into twelve equal portions
called the signs qf the Zodiac, which are named after the con-
stellations they contain.

The Nodes or Equinoxes are the points in which the ecliptic
cuts the equator. The sun in his course along the ecliptic from
West to East crosses the equator from South to North at the
time of the vernal equinox <March zlst) in the sign of the Ram
(see l. 687). His daily course in the sky then coincides exactly
