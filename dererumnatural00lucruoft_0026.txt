IV. SOME Docrnmsss or EPICURUS.

Philosophus nobilis, a quo non solum Graecia et ltalia sed etiam
omnis barbaria commota est.
Cicero De Fin. ii 49.

Epicurus was born at Samos in 342 B.C. He went to
Athens when he was thirty-five years old and there founded a
school of his own, in which he taught until his death in 270 Β. C.
He was almost worshipped by his disciples and was by all
accounts a most amiable and excellent man, and not at all an
Epicurean in our sense of the term. Before 200 B.C. his system
had found many supporters at Rome, though it was not so
congenial to the gravitas of the Roman character as the rival
system of the Stoics. The doctrines of Epicurus, which are
explained or mentioned by Lucretius in his fifth book, must be
briefly noticed here. These are,

(1) the theory of atoms and void;

(2) the nature of the soul;

(3) the nature of knowledge3

(4) the existence and nature of the gods;
(5) the theory of celestial phenomena.

(ι) ATOMS AND VOID. Epicurus adopted in its entirety
the atomio theory of Democritus, born in 460 Β. C. According
to this theory the whole universe consists of two things, body
(σῶμα, corpus), and void (τὸ κενόν, inane). The existence of
body or matter is proved by the evidence of our senses, the
existence of void partly by the possibility of motion, as bodies
could not move if there were no void or empty space for them
to move in, and partly by the unequal weight of bodies equal in
bulk: a ball of lead is heavier than a ball of wool only because
it contains less void. All body, which we may call matter, is
composed of atoms‚ to which Lucretius gives the names prin-
cipia, primordia rernm, corpora materiae. These atoms differ
