NOTES. 73

521. Summanus was an obscure deity (quisquis z's est, says Ovid)
who caused night—thunder ; hence Summania templa are the nightly
sky; for templa see n. to 1. 103.

522. aliunde αἶίιιιηιίεεᾶλλοθέν ποθεν, ‘from some other place’3
i.e.‚ the air is not, like the heats, shut up in the stars themselves,

523. versat agens, ‘drives and whirls’. Here again Lucr. seems
inconsistent in attributing volition to the stars3 we may account sor it
as we have already accounted for such epithets as aeternus and vivus
(ll. 402, 476).

524. euntes is nom. plur.

525. pascentes: the food of the stars is fire. Comp. i 231 unde
aether sidera pascit? Seneca (Nat. Quaest. vii ‘21 2) accounts thus sor
the motion of a comet: ignium modo alimentum suum sequitur.

526. quid sit eorum, ‘which of these (explanations) holds²3 an
indirect question aster ponere certum.

certum, ‘ for certain'.

527. possit: potis sit, ‘is possible '. omne, τὸ πᾶν, is the summa
summarum, the entire universe.

529. sequor disponere, ⁴1 go on to distinguish’ ; a rare use of
sequor = pergo.

531. hoc=lzac rerum summa, our world.

532. vegeat: an active verb. signis: dat. commodi. earum, sc.
causarum.

533. ρνοςνεᾶἱεηίώτ the adjectival or attm‘butive genitive3 rash
assertion is not the attribute of one who etc.

534-563. T lle eartlz remains at rest in tlze middle of the world
because the wezg'lct of its lower parts is less than tlzat of the upper.
Indeed its substance beneatlz is dfferent and more alez‘n to air. From
its long connexion witlz tlte air, the weiglct of tlte eartlt is not felt
any more than a man feels tlte wezglzt of lzis own limos. T he air
sustaz'ns tlte earth without effart just as tlte soul sustaz'ns tlze body.

535. pondus, sc. terrae.

536. convenit is impersonal.

naturam, ‘ substance “, is object to habere, terram being supplied as
subject. This substance of which the earth is composed below must be
lighter than earth itself in order to account sor the earth resting in the
middle of the world. Apparently Luer. conceived the earth to be a
more or less flat sursace both above aud below.
