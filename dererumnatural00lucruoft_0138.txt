102 LUCRETJUS. BOOK V.

fhr the order of the seasons and the other wonders they beheld r'n tlte
heavens.

1161. deum: gen. plur. magnas gentes: see n. to 1. το.

1¹62. pervulgarit: the indirect question depends on rationem
reddere, 1. 1168.

1163. sollemnia sacra, ‘ fixed ceremonies '3 this is the original
meaning of sollemnis which is connected with annum ‘solemn’ being a
secondary meaning.

1 164. sacra, but sdcra above 3 so iv 12 59 li‘quz'dis et liquida crassis.

rebu’, ‘occasions ’.

1165. unde=a qua causa; see l. 1161.

1166. toto orbi, ¹ over all the earth’ 3 so aethere toto, l. 398.

1167. cogit, sc. mortales. celebrare, ‘to throng them'3 see n. to
l. 1381.

1 168. non ita dffcile, ‘ not very difficult’ 3 so non ita pridem,
‘rather lately'. This line may be taken first in translating the sentence.

1169. quzppe etenim ε see n. to 1. 126.

divum goes with facies below.

mortalia saecla ε see n. to l. 791.

1 170. animo vigilante, ‘ with waking mind ’‚ i.e. when awake.
Lucr. seems to be inconsistent here: sor he said before (l. 148) that the

nature of the gods was too fine and impalpable for our senses to
perceive it. Comp. also vi 68—78.

1171. magis, se. videbant.

1173. For the idea that the gods ought to utter lofty words suitable
to their beauty and power, comp. the defence Aeschylus is supposed to
make for his long words, Aristoph. Frogs 1060

κᾶλλως εἰκὸς τοὺς ἡμιθέους τοῖς ῥήμασι μείζοσι χρῆσθαι,
καὶγὰρ τοῖς ἱματίοις ἡμῶν χρῶνται πολὺ σεμνοτέροισιν.

1 175. dabant, sc. deis homines.

1176. There was no time when these splendid visions ceased to
appear ; consequently men believed that the beings seen were im·
mortal.

1177. et tamen, ‘and without that'; i.e. even if the visions had
ceased to appear. omnino, ‘on general grounds’, repeats the same
idea. viribus auctos: see n. to ignibus aucta, 1. 723.

1178. convinci =vinci; so Shakespeare, Macbeth 1 7 64 ‘his cham-
berlaius will 1 with wine and wassail so convince ’, i.c. overcome.
