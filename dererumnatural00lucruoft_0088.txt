52 LUCRETIUS. BOOK V.

73. ille is often used by Lucr. to express vividly admiration or, as
here, contempt.

divom metus, δεισιδαιμονία, is the main cause of human misery, ac-
cording to Lucr.; and to banish it is the sole aim of the study of nature.

insinuarit is here intrans„ though not in 1. 445 the in of the verb
governs pectora.

74. qui‘ in: for the hiatus see n. to 1. 7. orbi is the archaic abl.;
again, l. 707. Lucr. uses also zgm', luci, parti, labi, in this book.
sancta and tuetur are to be taken together.

75. lacus are often coupled with luci as holy places.

77. natura gubernans, ‘piloting nature’; another metaphor from
a ship. Comp. 1. 107, from which it appears that natura and fortuna
are identical.

79. lz'bera' z see n. to l. 47. cursus: internal acc. aster lustrare.

80. morigera, ‘obliging enough’3 sarcastic. animantes: see n. to
1. 823·

81. ratione, ‘forethought'‚ προνοίᾳ.

82. qui, ‘even those who’. Part of the 1. is quoted by Horace,
Sat. i 5 101 deos didici securum agere aevum.

83. interea, ‘notwithstanding'; again 1. 394. Lucr. often uses
eodem tempore in the same sense ι see ll. 7 56, 765. ratione=mod0.

85. aetheriis in oris, ‘in the regions of aether ’. In Lucr. aether
is always the higher‚ unclouded sky, aer the lower abode of storms and
clouds : see 11. 500—504. orae luminis, ‘the regions of light’‚ i.e. the
world, is a savourite phrase of Lucr.

87. dominos acres, i.e. the gods; they are called domini superbi,
ii 1091.

89. finita etc.: ‘in short on what principle each thing has its
power defined and its deep-set boundary mark'. With terminus, sc.
finitus sit. The metaphor is from a land-mark dividing two properties;
here the terminus divides for each thing the possible from the im-
possible.

90. sit belongs to finita above; Lucr. likes to keep separate the
parts of these compound tenses; see ll. 177, 546, 583, 858, 1225,
1416.

91—109. To proceed to the demonstration I have promised, it is certain,
however astonz'shing it may sound, that the whole world will one day
bc destroyed. Yon yourself may live to see it.
