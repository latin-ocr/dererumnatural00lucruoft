andria. The pure taste of Lucretius revolted from the pre·
dominant sashion and attached itself to Ennius, and, through
Ennius, to the Classical Greek literature. Thus his philosophi-
cal creed and his litei-ary taste alike led him to discard all
such antiquarian and mythological lore as we see in the Cama
Berenices of Catullus, translated from Callimachus. The myth-
ology he resolutely refused to believe, and the only learning he
valued was that which had power to purify the hearts of men
and make their lives happy.

His zu-chmsmisseen both in the language and in the style.
He uses many old words and forms, from which Virgil selects
with discrimination ; and he also coins many new words which
no writer used aster him. He prefers to use a significantssreek

 

word in place of a seeble or obscure Latin equivalent. He is
fond of the artifices of alliteration and assonance, which seem
so congenial to early Latin and occur so constantly in Ennius
and still more in Plautus ; here again Virgil decidedly restricts
the practice of his predecessors. His semenees‘ar'e often exces-
sively long and loosely-constructed3 he is indifferent to> ambi-
guities' which his Augustan successors would not have tolerated ;
and his order of words is osten perplexing to those who are not
familiar with his style. Again his metre, though more refined
than that of Ennius, itself is wanting in harmony and especially
in variety, when compared with the perfect rhythm of Virgil.

The difficulty of Lucretius, which even the ancients few,
is partly due to his fondness for archaism‚ but also to the
inadequacy of the language as an instrument sor expressing
{ffstruse thought. Ennius had been able with rude vigour to
depict the early history of Rome, to lay down a model of heroic
verse for his successors, and to bequeath them a considerable
vocabulary. But the language was still, as Lucretius thrice
over complains2, a very imperfect vehicle for the discussion of
political, moral, and metaphysical ideas. The great measure of
success which he attains must have been the result of immense
labour.
