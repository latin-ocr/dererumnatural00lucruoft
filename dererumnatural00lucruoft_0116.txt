however nncch be subtractea' from tlte sun's path beneath tlte earth,
viz. the night, just as much must be added to his path above it,
viz. the day, tlte whole length of his path being constant. All this
you may see in a map of the heavens. Again, tlte long nights qs
winter may be due to a thickness of the air in certain regions which
prevents the sun from rising. Lastly‚ if we assume that a new sun
is born every* day, alternate slowness and quz'ckness in tlze streaming
together offires will account for tlte alternate length and shortness of
tlte days.
