NOTES. 51

55. rationes, ‘ reasonings '. Ι

56. The order is: doceo quam sit necessum quaeque durare in eo
fhedere quo creata sint.

57. durare, ‘to remain ’ ; but, 1. 1360, ‘to harden ’.

58- nec, i.e. quamque non, still after doceo.

59. quo genere etc-z ‘herein it has been found above all that the
nature of the mind ’. in primzk...prz'mum is very emphatic. In Luer.
animus always is the mind or reason (λόγος), anima the soul or life
(ψυχή), He is referring to his third book where he has proved this point
at great length. See Introduct. p. xxiii. animi natura is merely a
periphrasis sor animus, like mundi natura for mundum both occur
frequently3 see ll. 127, 132, 157, 239, 331, 365, 370, 834.

60. nativo, ‘that had birth ⁹. Lucr. uses nativus as--morlalz‘s and
opposed to aeternum so γενητὸς is often opposed to ἀίδιος.

corpore creta: see n. to cretus, l. 6.

62. solere: the acc. and inf. as if reperta in l. 59 were repertum.

He means to say that appearances of dead men in our dreams are
mere delusions and do nothing to prove the immortality of the soul.

63. videamur: the subj. here and in l. 681 seems to denote
frequency‚ though regularly quoties lzocfltz ὅταν τοῦτο ’γίγνηταη probably
the subj. is due to the semblance of oratio obliqua.

64. quod superest, lit. ‘as to what remains’, i.e. ‘to continue'; a
common formula of transition-

rationis, ‘ of my plan '. detulit, sc. me.

67. congressus materiai, ‘ union of matter '‚ formed by the ceaseless
strife and collision of atoms described in the second book.

68. fundarit: indirect question aster ratio reddunda sz't3 so also
extiterint, sint natae, coeperit, insinuarit below.

69· lunai ε Lucr. uses this archaic form and that in —ae (see l. 76)
indifferently as suits his verse. tellure, ⁶ from the earth ’.

aninzantes=anz'malz'a: see n. tol. 823.

70. Part of his plan is to disprove the existence of such fabulous
creatures as Centaurs and Chimeras; see 11. 878 foll.

71. quove: ve is for que, as the origin of speech is not an alter-
native but an additional topic: also l. 776. Munro thinks this
licence may be due to the ambiguity of quaque which might be a part
of quisque.

72. vesci=utiz rather different in l. 857. per, ‘in ’‚ ‘in the way
of ’ς so per iocum.
