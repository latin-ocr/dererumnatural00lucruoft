contact with other men, as the literature he loved belonged
entirely to the past. He was before all things a student. Much
of his time must have been spent in study of the Greek philo-
sophers and poets: he tells us himself that the absorbing
pursuit of his life, which he carried on through ‘the clear
nights' and which haunted him even in sleepl, was the study
of the philosophers and the exposition in his poem of their
‘glorious discoveries.' According to tradition, his master Epi-
curus himself left three hundred rolls, ‘golden words,' says
Lucretius, ‘on which 1 feed like a bee among the flowers2.’ And
besides Epicurus there are many other abstruse and voluminous
writers whose authority he acknowledges or whose dogmas he
refutes ; Empedocles and Democritus are conspicuous among
the first, Heraclitus and Anaxagoras among the second. He
also translates from or imitates the following Greek authors:
Homer, Hesiod, Euripides, Thucydides, Hippocrates, and per-
haps Aristophanes and Plato. Among Latin writers, we can
trace imitation of Ennius and his nephew Pacuvius, the chief
epic poet and the chief tragedian of early Latin literature.
Finally, from the truth and evident pleasure with which he
describes all manner of natural objects and illustrates his
arguments by them, we may infer that his life was spent for the
most part in the country. We may think of Lucretius in some
quiet place, away from ‘the smoke and wealth and noise of
Rome'3 we may fancy him watching the clouds on the hills or
the waves on the shore with the delight of a poet and the

keen interest of a philosopher, or poring over the scrolls of
Epicurus, and studying how he might best transfer their
precious contents to his own immortal poem.
