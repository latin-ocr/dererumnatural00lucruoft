NOTES. 69

432—448. In the original chaos ther e were no sepa) ate objects, no sun or
moon, no earth, sky, orsea, only a medley of warring atoms: gradually
the parts of the world began to separate. N&

432. hic, ‘’then 3 again, 1. 1002· , it seems not to differ from tum.

433. mundi=caeli‚ as often.

435. nostris rebus, ‘the things we see ⁹. videri is passive.

436. ‘ but only a strange stormy crisis and medley’ ; so Ovid (Met.
i 7) calls chaos rudis indigestaque moles.

437. omne genus is adverbial, going with principiis 3 id genus and
quod genus also are so used3 see n. to l. 428.

quorum goes with discordia, and out of it eorum is to be supplied

with all the accusatives governed by turbabat.

monious’.

pounded, imply separation, dis- being used four times and se· five times;

place to a consec. subjunctive; see n. to efficerent 1. 454.

448. aetheris ignes are the heavenly bodies.

449—494. The heavy atoms met together z‘n the middle of chaos ond by
their close unz'on squeezed out the smaller and leghter atoms. These
rose up and formed the ether, which walls in the world, and the
heavenly bodies, whose atoms are lzjghter than those of earth, heavz'er
than those of ether. When these had withdrawn, the hollows which
the sea now fllls, were flooded with salt water‚· and as condensation
of the earth constantly went on owing to the heat of ether and the
sun, therefore more lzgrlzt atoms of ether and salt atoms of sea-water
were constantly squeezed out.

449. quippe etenim : see n. to 1. 126.

450. perplexa, sc. inter se.
