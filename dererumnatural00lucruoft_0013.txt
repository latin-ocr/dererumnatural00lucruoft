I. Liri: OF LUCRETIUS.

IVec vixit male qui natus moriensque fefhllit.
Horace Ep. i 17 10.

THE chronicle of Hieronymus or St Jerome, compiled about
400 A.D., has a record to the following effect: ‘the poet Titus
Lucretius Carus was born in 94 Β. C.; he lost his reason in
consequence of drinking a love-philtre and died by his own
hand in his forty-fourth year, after composing in his lucid
intervals several books which Cicero afterwards corrected) The
date of his death would thus be 50 B. C. But Donatus, who is
more generally followed, in his life of Virgil mentions as a
remarkable coincidence that Lucretius died (nothing is said of
madness or suicide) on October Isth, 55 B.C., the day on which
Virgss, being just fifteen, assumed the loga virilis.

We may then assume with sair probability that Lucretius
was born in 99 B. C., and died in the autumn of 55. The other
statements made by St Jerome are even more doubtful than his
chronology. For first, with regard to the alleged madness and
suicide, it is very strange that such a tragical ending of a great
genius is nowhere mentioned by any subsequent Latin writer.
And on the other hand the story was just such a pious fiction

heterodoxy of Lucretius. lt is worth noticing that a similar
end was invented for Lucian, another Epicurean heretic : he is
said by Suidas to have been torn to pieces by dogs. Again it
seems highly improbable that the poem was written in the lucid
intervals of a madman: the argument is severely logical, the
arrangement masterly‚ in those parts of the poem which are not
