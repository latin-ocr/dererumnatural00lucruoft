54 LUCRETJUS. BOOK V.

108. ratio, ‘reasoning’3 res, ‘the reality’.
109. succz'dere...victa: translate by two co-ordinate verbs. ,fi-agor

is defined by Seneca (Nat. Quaest. ii 27 3) as a sound subitus et
vehemens.

110—234. The editors point. out that these lines interrupt the argu-
ment, which is to prove the precarious existence of the world, and are
out of place here. There are many such passages, especially in the
last two books; they are rough drasts which Lucr. did not live long

enough to fit properly into his text. A number of the verses are copied
from his earlier books.

110—-145, Yon must not think z't profane to deny tlze dz'vinz'ty and
permanence of tlte external world. lee mind cannot exist outside
tlte body ; indeed z't can exist only z'n one special part qs tlte body
z'tseif. Tlm‘efore earth, fire, ‘abatem and air cannot bave lzse and
consequently are not divine.

110. qua prius adgy‘ediar quam de re=sed prius qnam adgrediar
de hac re. fata, ⁴ decrees of fate '.

114. ne-rearisz m with the ‘znd pers. of the pres. subj. makes a
final clause, not a prohibition, always in Lucr. and generally in writers
of the best period; in Greek the same rule is invariable. But Horace
at least once (Sat. ii 3 88) and very early and late poets (e.g. Plautus
and Martial) use ne facias as=nefeceris or noli facere.

116. corpore divino: abl. of description.

117. putes: subj. after ne 1. 114. Gigantum: they were punished
sor their impious attack on heaven by being struck by thunderbolts 01
imprisoned under mountains; Hor. Od. iii 4 73 iniecta monstris Terra
dolet suis.

119. disturbent moenia mundi, ‘displace the walls of the world ’‚
i.e. by saying it must perish. disturbent and velint below are subj.‚
because they are in dependent clauses of oratio obliqua.

121. notantes, ‘blaming’ ; used technically of the eensors.

122. quae refers back to l. 116, the last 5 ll. being parenthetical,
and includes the things enumerated in 1. 115. The Mss- have distent
here and videri, not videntur, below ; this construction is so harsh that
Ι have admitted the conjecture os Madvig.

123. The order is: et videntur indigna quae sint. With indigna,
sc. usque adeo again.

124. notitiam, ‘a notable instance '. putentur: putari possint.
