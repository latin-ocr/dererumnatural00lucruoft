INTROD UCTJON. xiii

in his last four books some special applications of that doctrine,
which formed part of the system of Epicurus. The aim of the
poet throughout is not so much purely scientific as practical and
ngnjal. His main object, as he tells us again and again, is to
free men's minds from the yoke of superstitious fears by dis-
playing to them the aspect and the laws of nature3 and this is
why he argues with such passionate earnestness against the
immortality of the soul and the interference of the gods in
human affairs. Thus the purpose of the fifth book is to show
that the world and all that it contains were not created by
divine power, and that all progress is the result of natural
experience, not of divine guidance. And on the whole it
appears that Lucretius lived long enough to complete in out-
line the whole task he had set before himself, though the latter
part of the poem is far from complete in artistic finish and
arrangement of materials.

With regard to the diction and metre of the poem, Lucretius
deliberately adopted a style which rnust have seemed archaie to
his contemporaries. This may be seen by comparing the De
Rerum Natura with the Peleus and Thetis of Catullus, which
was certainly written at nearly the same time. Just as Greek
epic verse continued to the end to imitate the forms and
vocabulary of Homer, so Lucretius thought fit to take for his
model the Annales of Ennius, the only great epie which the
language possessed, though two centuries had passed since it
was written. At the beginning of his own poem he makes
honourable mention of Enniusl, and constantly imitates even the
few hundred lines of fragments which we possess. It is pro-
bable too that his archaism was intended as a protest against
the tendency of contemporary Latin literature. For just at this
time there was great literary activity among the Romans.
Any educated man could, as Mommsen says, turn off his five
hundred hexameters at a sitting; Quintus Cicero wrote four
tragedies in a fortnight to beguile the dulness of winter—quarters
in Gaul. But all these poems were worthless imitations of bad
models,—of Callimachus and the other learned poets of Alex-
