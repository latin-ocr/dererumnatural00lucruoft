in size, shape‚ and weight, and are unlimited in number. They
have existed from everlasting and can never be split up or
destroyed in any way, because they are solid and indivisible,
containing no void. They are in constant motion, being
impelled downwards by their own weight and sideways by the
blows of other atoms; they are so small that our sight cannot
perceive them. Void also is unlirnited in extent3 and so the
universe, which is made up of these two constituents, is also
unlimited. A finite world such as ours, including earth, sea,
and sky, is formed whenever a concourse of atoms, after many
fruitless experiments, have assumed positions which enable
them to move for a time without separating from one another.
But a world so formed, as it had a beginning, will also have
an end3 and the liberated atoms will then continue their race
through void and take part in future combinations. All these
operations are the result of chance, not of design.

It was certainly a happy intuition that induced Epicurus,
indifferent as he was to science in general, to adopt this scien-
tificrtheory. His contemporaries thought it ridiculous, but
modern science has accepted it as true in the main. .‘ The
propositions in which Lucretius has stated his atomic theory
anticipate some recent discoveries in both chemistry and physics
in a most marvellous way. Science has now proved that his
propositions as to the constitution of matter are either certainly
true, or else foreshadow the truth1.’

(2) THE SOUL. The psychology of Epicurus is strictly
materialistic, and admits no difference between mind and
matter. Just as the body is made up of atorns, so is the soul
or vital principle (ψυχή, anima), and the mind or rational
principle (λόγος, animus). The only difference is that the soul
and mind consist of the smallest and lightest atoms; this is
proved by the speed os thought and by the fact that the body,
when life has ceased, is not diminished in size and weight.
The vital principle is diffused over the whole body ; the rational
principle has its seat in the breast. The soul, under which
both anima and animus may be included, cannot exist apart
