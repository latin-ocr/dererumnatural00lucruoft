NOTES. 53

91. quod superest: see n. to 1. 64. plum: adverbial use of
adjective; so acerba 1. 33.

93. Memmi: see n. to 1. 8. Here the personal appeal invites
special attention.

94. species=elc5m ‘things so unlike in appearance ’ς 1. 569, species:
‘ our sight '-

95. Ovid (Am. i 15 23) quotes from this line to pay a fine compli-
ment to its author:

carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti,
exitio terras cum dabit una dies.

96. ruet, ‘ will go to ruin’; ruere is also transitive sometimes in
Lucr., e.g. 1. 1325.

moles et machina, ‘mass and fabric'3 moles suggests size, machina
complexity.

97. animi, ‘in my mind‘, a locative like humi, ruri, domz’; common
also with adjectives like dubius, aeger. fallit is impersonal.

res nova miraque: constr. as if it were novum mirumque; exitium
futurum is the subject to accidat.

99. id is object to pervincere.

100. fit=soletficri. ubi rem adportes=ubi res αιζρονίαίιινς but the
Latin idiorn requires the subj. in the second person, e.g. bonus segnior fit
ubi neglegas (Sallust). We say ‘when one brings ’. ante is an adverb
and goes with insolitam.

101. visu is contracted from visui.

102. indu and endo are archaic forms of the prep. in; the d
survives in indigeo, compound of egeo. Lucr. uses indugredi, indupea'ire‚
induperator, the last for metrical reasons, though the verbs can be
separated by tmesis from their preposifions, e.g. inque pedire.

via qua ete. ε ‘where a beaten path of convictiou leads most directly’.
The meaning is: anything which appeals to sight or touch is readily
believed ; just so Horace, A. P. 180 segnius inritant animos demissa per
aurem, quam quae sunt oculis subiecta fidelz’bus; Tennyson, Enoch
Arden, ‘things seen are mightier than things heard ².

103. templa mentis, ‘quarters of the mind’ ; so Lucr., iv 624,
speaks of the mouth as linguai templa, Plautus, Mil. Glor. 412, of the
sea as Neptunia templa, templa being=l0ca in old Latin.

104. dabit fidem: in prose sacietficlem.

106. in, ⁴ in the course οῖ’.

107. Comp. l. 77,
