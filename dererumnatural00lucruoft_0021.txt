JNTR OD U C TI ON. xvii

Fortunatus et ille, deos qui novit agrestes,
Panaque Silvanumque senem Nymphasque sorores¹.

1t is evident that in these and the preceding lines Virgil is
instituting a comparison, to his own disadvantage, between
Lucretius, who had ventured to explain the laws of nature, and
himself, who was content with loving and describing her
external aspects. We may compare the similar contrast drawn
by Matthew Arnold between Goethe and WVordsworth, in which
Virgil's words are thus applied to Goethe :

And he was happy, if to know
Causes of things, and far below
His feet to see the lurid flow
Of terror, and insane distress,
And headlong sate, be happiness.

Virgil was a most modest man and no doubt sincerely
believed that Lucretius was a greater genius than himself. But
if he did so, he stood almost alone among his countrymen. The
Arma virumque, as the Roman poets love to call the Aeneid2‚
entirely eclipsed the Aeneadum genetrix with the Roman
public, if indeed the latter ever had any vogue at all ; and even
the few, who ventured to disparage Virgi13, do not seem to have
set up Lucretius as a rival object of admiration. Itwas reserved
for our own century to extol the earlier poet at the expense of
the later. Johnson maintained with accustomed vigour against
Burke the superiority of Homer to Virgil ; but if any rash
member of the Club had substituted Lucretius for Homer, it is
probable that Johnson and Burke would have made common
cause against so novel a paradox. During the present century,
however, the comparison has often been made ; and the verdict
of the learned has gone, on the whole, in favour of Lucretius.
This is not the place to enter on a discussion of such wide range
and doubtful value ; but, if it be admitted that a nation is com-
petent to judge its own literature, it should also be remembered
